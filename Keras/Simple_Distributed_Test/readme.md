Use Keras and Tensorflow to develop a simple distributed example.
There is one parameter server(ps), and one worker server.
This model is a complicated one, you can just replace it for a easier one.

![ps.py](https://github.com/THUfl12/Tensorflow/blob/master/Keras/Simple_Distributed_Test/ps.py): start parameter server. <br>
![worker.py](https://github.com/THUfl12/Tensorflow/blob/master/Keras/Simple_Distributed_Test/worker.py): start worker server. <br>
Be sure the id address is right!
